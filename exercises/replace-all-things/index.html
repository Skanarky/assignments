    <main class="main">
        <p>The senate decided on early Friday meeting that taxes will be no more needed!</p>
        <p>The US has reached a <span>GDP</span> that will be covering everybody's needs. Soon we can also expect that there'll be no more
            need for working. While a lot layers of the society are celebrating the "happy" news, a lot of people are still
            sceptical if the new system will work in the longterm and what will be the moral consequences. We've seen in
            our times a lot of examples of people doing not really "nice" things when having no occupation. Like the old
            saying goes: <span>"A man without a job - that is a crazy man!"</span>
