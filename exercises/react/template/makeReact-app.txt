Tips on how to make an app:
1) Plan ahead! Start with the big picture and narrow down from there. Brainstorm -> Wireframe -> user story -> folder structure -> pseudocode -> code
2) Work toward small milestones. Don't try to build the entire thing all at once
3) If you get frustrated, go on a walk or do something else for a little bit
4) takes lots of breaks
5) collaborate with your classmates, this isn't a competition, you're here to help each other succeed :slightly_smiling_face:
