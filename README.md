V School Assignments  
====================

This is the main README file for all the assignments from V School.

Each of the directories here represents a warmup (daily, short practices), exercise (completed immediately after learning a new topic), or a project (used to test my abilities in given areas of web development) that I have worked on during my time at V School.

All the projects in the 'project' directory have README files, which explains the given assignment as well as a summary of the technologies and skills that I learned/used through completing the project.
