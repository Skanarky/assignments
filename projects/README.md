PROJECTS 
====================

Projects are assignments specifically geared towards testing my ability to demonstrate an understandind in a collection of topics.

Projects represent a culmination of both topics that have been recently learned as well as those that have already been tested in the past.

Passing a project is akin to "earning a merit badge" or "leveling up."

As time progresses the projects become more intense as they naturally build off of everything I have learned up to the point of the current project. In the beginning they're typically due in 1 or 2 days and towards the end of the course I and my schoolmates were usually given between 1 and 2 weeks to complete a project.
